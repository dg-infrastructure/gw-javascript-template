# Library Template

## Purpose

This is where the decription of the library will go.

## Versioning

We are following the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). During initial development, the major
version is to 0 (e.g., `0.x.y`), which indicates the code does not yet have a stable API. Once we hit `1.0.0`, we will
follow these rules:

1. Increment the patch version for backwards-compatible bug fixes (e.g., `v1.0.8 -> v1.0.9`).
2. Increment the minor version for new features that are backwards-compatible (e.g., `v1.0.8 -> 1.1.0`).
3. Increment the major version for any backwards-incompatible changes (e.g. `1.0.8 -> 2.0.0`).

The version is defined using Git tags.  Use GitHub to create a release, which will have the effect of adding a git tag.
